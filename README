ca-tools provides utilities to deliver and manage a complete PKI configuration
for workstations and servers using only standard Unix utilities, OpenSSL,
p11-kit, and Python-3.

The update-certdata utility will check the existng local version of
certdata.txt against the version in Mozzila's HG instance for NSS, and if
necessary, download and install an updated version. It will then proceed to
populate the P11-kit trust anchors using Mozilla's trust arguments.
Additionally, if any p11-kit format files are in place in the local directory,
they will overwrite those taken from the Mozilla store.

The update-ccadb utility will download the latest version of certificate
bundles from the Common CA Database managed by Mozilla, Microsoft, and Google.
It will then proceed to populate the P11-kit trust anchors using the trust
values for the bundles downloaded. Additionally, if any p11-kit format files
are in place in the local directory, they will overwrite those taken from the
CCADB bundles.

The add-local-trust utility will take a PEM formatted CA Root and convert to
a P11-Kit formatted file and place into a local directory with the trust bit
selected by the user. These files will later override trust in the above two
certificate sources.
